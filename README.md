# StandardGlaserGl
A project with some generally applicable Java functions and classes (mainly about Swing).

I use it for some of my Java applications. However, I am not satisfied with its current state and thus, I do not recommend using it. Nevertheless, I think some classes (e.g., custom JComponents) are interesting to look into and maybe get some inspiration.

## Usage
First, install this Java application via Maven, i.e., `mvn install` in a console opened in the cloned repositoy.

Then, add the dependency
```xml
<dependency>
	<groupId>glasergl</groupId>
	<artifactId>StandardGlaserGl</artifactId>
	<version>0.0.1-SNAPSHOT</version>
</dependency>
```
to the `pom.xml` of an application in which you want to use this library.
