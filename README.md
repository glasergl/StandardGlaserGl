# StandardGlaserGl
A project with some generally applicable Java functions and classes (mainly about Swing).

I use it (as Maven dependency, installed by yourself with ) for some of my Java applications. However, I am not satisfied with its current state and thus, I do not recommend using it. Nevertheless, I think some concepts or customized JComponents are interesting to look into and maybe get some inspiration.

## Usage
1. Install via Maven (*mvn install* in a console opened in the cloned repositoy)
1. Add dependency
```xml
<dependency>
	<groupId>glasergl</groupId>
	<artifactId>StandardGlaserGl</artifactId>
	<version>0.0.1-SNAPSHOT</version>
</dependency>
```
to your `pom.xml`.
